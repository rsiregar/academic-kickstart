###### **World Price Shocks, Trade Policy Shocks, and Internal Migration: Evidence from Indonesia**
_Job Market Paper_
Abstract:  study how regions respond to price shocks when there is internal migration. I examine Indonesia in the 2000s as it faced both a commodity boom and initiated import restrictions on rice, a staple food for its large population. I exploit the variation in the importance of palm-oil and rice across district economies to measure their exposure to shocks. I find that districts exposed to palm-oil price shocks have significantly higher outcomes compared to the non-exposed ones. However, there is not much significant difference between districts exposed to rice price shocks and those not exposed. Gains from migration explains one-third of the welfare change in the period of 2005 to 2010, providing significance to including internal migration in welfare analysis.
